Modular Automation Navigator for Task Regulation & Action  
A Fully Local, Modular, Voice-Driven AI Personal Assistant.

# Overview

MANTRA is an offline, extensible personal AI assistant designed to run entirely on your machine.
It listens for your custom wake word “Maya”, understands your speech using local models, interprets your intent through a structured action schema, and performs tasks on your computer—all without the cloud.

MANTRA is built to be:

    Local & Privacy-First – No data leaves your device

    Modular – Every component is isolated and replaceable

    Cross-Platform Ready – macOS MVP → Windows & Linux support planned

    Scalable – Designed to plug into cloud backends and MCP (Model Context Protocol) in future versions

The goal:

    Create a local assistant with a clean architecture that can grow into a cross-platform autonomous agent.
